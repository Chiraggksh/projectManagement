/* Project start:
# At start of the project we do: npm init --> ye ek node ecosystem set up krdeta h so that package.json file bnti h
which is identity card + config file of the project

why need?: Because Node projects depend on:
             external libraries (React, Express, Mongoose, etc.)
             scripts (start, build, test)
             versions (very important in real-world projects)

             package.json answers questions like:
            📦 What is this project?
            🔢 Which dependencies does it use?
            ⚙️ How do I run it?
            🧠 Which version is stable? etcc
aapse details lega and json file bnadega

what is npm init -y then? --> zyada details ni mngta fas fas json file bnadeta h

ab jse manle tune express install kia ya kuch aisa install kia toh vo khud json me change hojaegaa bina kch add kre thats so important*/

/* change type:"modules"
now the thing is package json me type:"modules" krle to have some requirement like this -- isse u can use import export types
and can also do some changes in script
difference between module and commonjs : module mtlb ki import export jo ki standard h and commonJs is old and uses require
common js is by default hence we change the type in package.json 

 */

/*# install prettier as dependency
to make version control into sync: ki semicolon lgega ya ni ya fir tab spaces kitne honge thats why same ground hoga
hence u use prettier : some commands --> npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
prettierrc: for configuration
.prettierignore : to ignore formatting some files
orr baaki docs me check krlena 
npx prettier . --write : to write
npx prettier . --check : to check 
*/

/* nodemon + env set
#to automatically restart your server u use nodemon
in package json mein start is used for production so node is used and dev is used to develop so usme hm nodemon use krr skte h

# env ka use?
bhai server dont store everything because there are chances that can get leaked hence they use a secure information to take the data from there
hence we use .env : phle package download krr iska : and check for documentations and setup krow, config krow and then use them in your work

 */

//Project structure
/*
public folder will be serving static files like images, etc
src folder: have codes have different folder -> controllers (all function logic etc), db (creation, deletion, updation everything), middlewares, models (structure how u keep data in db)
                                                routes (all routing info), utils (emails etc), validators (to validate data)
*/

/* setting express and postman
express setup krow: used to send data on it routes bnane me bhot kaam ata h : see docs
postman: api testing tool h yee -> new collection: new folder: then new request ---> can set variables as well
*/

/* restructure code for personal preference
Restructuring code again : separation of app with index : ek alg hi file rkhoww express ki name app.js and just import that in index.js looks very clean
 */

/* express configuration and CORS
CORS issue tb aata h jb frontend and backend alg alg port prr kaam kr rhe ho and browser stop krde sharing and connection because of security issues ese to bhtt dikkate aane lgegi isliee
hence we use middlewares : act as middle layer in server jb b frontend interacts with backend
basic config of express middleware + cors config done + u need to download cors dependency

see app.js
*/

/*standardisation of apiResponse and apiErrors
turns out server se 2 hi cheeze jaa skti h either errors or response : error is efficiently set up by node ecosystem by Error class hme bss reponse ko setup krna h
hence check src/utils and now we wont sent by res.send we will use our own apiResponse class
*/

/*keeping data in constants
data 2 tarike ke h: ek sensitive so we handled .env file for that
now constants me kch b changes hongee toh constants kr skte h check : utils/constants.js
*/

/* connect with mongoDB
vahi mann jo seekha tha tune about mongoose ORM use krte h to connect with mongodb into much nicer and good format:
read about mongoose and make a default function to connect and mongoatlas setup krow and callit on index simple

*/

/* healthcheck route
so this is itt bhaii mere this much minimum preparation is generally required to complete your basic setup and project how u do it

now jb b hm aws ya kahi b dalte h there is always healthcheck jo system ki health btata h : so basically overall work ab kch aisa hoga ki we will use controllers jisme hmara main logic hoga, routes jisme saare endpoint serve honge, and then we will be calling them on app.js
router mein bhi boiler plate use hota h ek check in routes folder

now we will use try catch ka alternative 

*/

/*CAtch error better with async handler
vahi bhaii async await vala scene add krdo jb b db se lena ho so avoid too many try catch : next ka use in other way check in utils/async-handler and it is a genericc function
u can use it anywhere
*/
