/*
At start of the project we do: npm init --> ye ek node ecosystem set up krdeta h so that package.json file bnti h
which is identity card + config file of the project

why need?: Because Node projects depend on:
             external libraries (React, Express, Mongoose, etc.)
             scripts (start, build, test)
             versions (very important in real-world projects)

             package.json answers questions like:
            📦 What is this project?
            🔢 Which dependencies does it use?
            ⚙️ How do I run it?
            🧠 Which version is stable? etcc
aapse details lega and json file bnadega

what is npm init -y then? --> zyada details ni mngta fas fas json file bnadeta h

ab jse manle tune express install kia ya kuch aisa install kia toh vo khud json me change hojaegaa bina kch add kre thats so important
now the thing is package json me type:"modules" krle to have some requirement like this
